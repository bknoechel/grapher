## Grapher

Grapher is an open source web app to display simple datasets with a graph. The objective of this project is to showcase a simple web application built with React and other modern front end technologies.


## What technologies are used in Grapher?
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)


## Usage
The main use case of Grapher is to copy simple tabular data from excel and paste it into Grapher, which will draw a graph of your data.


## Run locally
- Clone the project and run `npm i` to add packages.
- Run with `npm start`


## Run tests
- Once node modules are installed, use `npm test` to run unit tests

I've run into issues with flaky tests I think related to jest and babel 7 but typically rerunning will resolve them.
